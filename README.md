# MNIST-MLP
This project includes a simple neural network (MLP) model trained on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras with both model.fit() and a manual training loop. The training process includes data preparation, model construction, loss/optimization operations, and evaluation steps. 

MNIST data is read using the specially configured Dataloader class using the original binary files (ubytes) and not TensorFlow.
